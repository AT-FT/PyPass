# PyPass: A Python Password Manager
A secure and user-friendly Password Management System built using Python, Tkinter for the graphical user interface, and MySQL for database storage.

# Introduction:
I usually set obscenely long passwords as mental exercise for myself and sometimes my brain indeed fails me, so I decided to code a basic personal password manager to store all my passwords in a MySQL database using Python as a coding project.
